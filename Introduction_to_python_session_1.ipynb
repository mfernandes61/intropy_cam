    "- Python is a *dynamic, interpreted* general purpose programming language initially created by Guido van Rossum in 1991\n",
    "- It is a powerful language that supports several popular programming paradigms:\n",
    "    - procedural\n",
    "    - object-oriented\n",
    "    - functional\n",
    "- Python is widely used in bioinformatics and scientific computing, as well as many other fields and in industry\n",
    "- Python is considered to come with \"batteries included\" and the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/\">standard library</a> (some of which we will see in this course) provides built-in support for lots of common tasks:\n",
    "    - interacting with files and the operating system\n",
    "    - working on networks and the internet\n",
    "    - numerical & mathematical functions \n",
    "    - graphical user interfaces\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "- There is also a wide range of external libraries for areas not covered in the standard library, such as the BioPython project which provides tools for bioinformatics - we look at this briefly tomorrow\n",
    "- Python is available on all popular operating systems\n",

    "\n",
    "Constructing more complex strings from a mix of variables of different types can be cumbersome, and sometimes you want more control over how values are interpolated into a string. Python provides a powerful mechanism for formatting strings using format specifiers inside a string which start with a <tt>%</tt> character. There are lots of these specifiers, but here are 3 useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <tt>%d</tt>: decimal integer\n",
    "- <tt>%f</tt>: floating point number\n",
    "- <tt>%s</tt>: string\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify the number of decimal points to use in a floating point number with, e.g. <tt>%.2f</tt> to use 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have built your format string, you can insert the values into it with the <tt>%</tt> operator followed by a tuple of the values you want to interpolate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Format strings are particularly useful if you want to print out a message in a similar format multiple times, as you can save the format string in a variable and then use it with different variables."
