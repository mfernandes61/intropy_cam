# This exercise should be done in the interpreter

# 1. Create a variable and assign it the string value of your first name,
# assign your age to another variable (you are free to lie!), print out a message saying how old you are

name = "myname"
age = 21

print name, "is", age


# Use the addition operator to add 10 to your age and print out a message saying how old you will be in 10 years time

age += 10

print name, "will be", str(age), "in 10 years"

# Assign numerical values to 2 variables, calculate the mean of these two variables
# and store the result in another variable. Print out the result to the screen

v1 = 5.0
v2 = 10.0
mean = (v1 + v2) / 2
print mean
